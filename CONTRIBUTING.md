## How to

This project aims to keep its build system minimal and standard.
The build should use only built-in python tools or tools described in PEPs.

### Why pyproject.toml
- [PEP 518](https://peps.python.org/pep-0518/) introduced `pyproject.toml` as a standard for build systems.
- [The python packaging documentation](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/packaging-projects/#creating-pyproject-toml) description of `pyproject.toml`.
- [The pip documentation on pypa](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/build-system/pyproject-toml/) on how to write a `pyproject.toml`.

### Why not setup.py
- [The pip documentation on pypa](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/build-system/setup-py/) explanation that setup.py is deprecated

### What is setup.cfg
- [The setuptools documentation on pypa](https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/userguide/declarative_config.html) describes `setup.cfg`.
